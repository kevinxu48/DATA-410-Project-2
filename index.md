### Conclusion

By comparing the Locally Weighted Regression with Random Forest Regression on the "Cars" dataset, we found that The Loess produced a smaller cross-validated MSE than that of Random Forest. Since we desire smaller MSE values, we can conclude that Locally Weighted Regression is superior to Random Forest Regression in this example. Given the prevalence and importance of Random Forest, this project demonstrates the significance and potential of Locally Weighted Regression.
